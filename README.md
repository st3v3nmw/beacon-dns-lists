# Blocklists & Allowlists for Beacon DNS

Since we primarily use blocklists as filters and allowlists to remove false positives in a category,\
allowlists have higher precedence than blocklists.

The goal is to have sensible defaults that work well for all users.

Please report false positives in the default blocklists here or in the upstream blocklists.
