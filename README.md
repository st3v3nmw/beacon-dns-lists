# Blocklists & Allowlists for Beacon DNS

Since we primarily use blocklists as filters and allowlists to remove false positives in a category,\
allowlists have higher precedence than blocklists. There should be only one allowlist per category.

Please report false positives here or in the upstream blocklists.
